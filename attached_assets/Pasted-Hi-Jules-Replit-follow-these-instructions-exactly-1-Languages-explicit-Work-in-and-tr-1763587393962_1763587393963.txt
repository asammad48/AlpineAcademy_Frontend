Hi Jules / Replit — follow these instructions exactly.

1) Languages (explicit)

Work in (and translate into) these languages only:

Spanish — root (no /es/)

English — /en/

Portuguese — /pt/

Catalan — /ca/

French — /fr/

Do not add other language folders.

2) Primary Goals & Order of Work

Spanish first — update/create every Spanish HTML file in the root with finalized Spanish copy and correct links.

Then copy Spanish structure to /en/, /pt/, /ca/, /fr/ and replace text with correct translations.

Fix all internal links in every HTML file so they point to the correct language-specific URL (see Rules below).

Run the link-checker (instructions and a JS snippet below) to detect any 404s or broken internal links. Fix each broken link by either:

creating the missing page (with correct SEO title/meta and Spanish-based structure), or

correcting the href to the proper language path / file.

Confirm every site page loads without 404.

3) Link rules (strict — follow exactly)

All internal links must use language-aware absolute paths:

Spanish (root pages): links must point to /page.html (e.g. /clases-de-esqui-baqueira.html)

English: links must point to /en/page.html (e.g. /en/ski-lessons-baqueira.html)

Portuguese: /pt/page.html

Catalan: /ca/page.html

French: /fr/page.html

Do not use relative ../ tricks across languages. Always use the absolute path format above to avoid mistakes.

For language switcher links (header/footer):

When on Spanish page /clases-de-esqui-baqueira.html, the language-switch links must be:

English → /en/ski-lessons-baqueira.html

Portuguese → /pt/aulas-de-esqui-baqueira.html

Catalan → /ca/classes-desqui-baqueira.html

French → /fr/cours-de-ski-baqueira.html

When on English page /en/ski-lessons-baqueira.html, link back to Spanish → /clases-de-esqui-baqueira.html, and so on.

Social/contact links (email, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Google Business) are global — same URL in every page.

4) Translation & Content rules

Use the Spanish root page as the master/layout/template. Copy the full HTML structure (head tags, header, footer, markup/classes). Only change the textual content and the <title> / <meta description> to the target language.

Do not change CSS classes or JS filenames.

Keep the same markup semantics (semantic tags, heading order) for accessibility and SEO consistency.

Add lang attribute on <html> for each file:

Spanish pages: <html lang="es">

English: <html lang="en">

Portuguese: <html lang="pt">

Catalan: <html lang="ca">

French: <html lang="fr">

5) File creation policy when a link points to a missing page

If the link points to /en/some-page.html and that file does not exist, create /en/some-page.html using the Spanish version as template and translate the content.

If a link should instead point to a different page, fix the href instead of creating duplicate content.

7) Quick developer checklist (one-per-page)

For each page in each language, tick off:

 File exists at the exact path (see master file list you already have).

 <html lang="..."> set correctly.

 <title> and <meta name="description"> translated.

 Header / footer language links point to the matched-language paths (use absolute paths as above).

 Internal links point to same-language pages (or to global social/contact URLs).

 Page returns 200 on HTTP HEAD (not 404).

 Social links present and correct.

 No console errors on page load (open console and check).

8) If you prefer an automated fix flow (for Replit / local)

Option A (manual): Use the browser link-checker above, and fix pages manually in Replit (copy Spanish, translate, update href).

Option B (automated script in Replit): If you allow JS execution (small Node script), I can provide a Node-based crawler that:

Crawls the site,

Reports broken links,

Optionally creates placeholder HTML files in the correct folders (must be run in project repository with write access).

Note: this is optional — you previously required HTML/CSS/JS only; a Node script is JS but may require running on Replit shell. Tell me if you want this and I'll produce it.

9) Deliverable expectations

Spanish (root) pages — all content translated and final.

For each other language: same HTML structure + content translated.

All internal links fixed so no 404s remain for internal pages.

Final report: a small JSON or CSV list of any broken links found & actions taken (created file / updated href).
